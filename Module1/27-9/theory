Software Architecture Layers:

Presentation->Represent[View]
Application->Mediator between presentaion and data
DataLayer->data layer will handle database[insert,update,delete]

tiers

1)1-tier ->Layer 3 in 1 box
2)2-tier -> Layer 3 in 2 box
3)3-tier -> Layer in 3 box

N-Tier


System Environment Flow ->

Devlopment -> QA[Quality Analyst] -> UAT[User Acceptance Testing]-> Production


Static Testing[Early Testing]->Fixed -> Without Code Executing

Dynamic Testing ->Not Fixed -> With Code Executing


7 Key Principle

1) Testing Shows Presence of Defects

2) Exhaustive Testing is Impossible 
->Every Combination of input is not check to possible

3) Early Testing
-> It will Start ASAP

4) Defect Clustering
-> If You have any error make sure it will not spread in your system

5) The Pesticide Paradox
-> Regularly Review and Revised

6) Testing is context dependent
-> Every Website having a diffrent way to check

7) Absence of Error Fallacy
-> When Testing is Perfect but requirement does not match
